      <description>Once upon a time &amp;hellip; I heard a small corporate story which I would like to share. This is an interesting and inspiring management story. Once upon a time in a renowned organization an old CEO was to retire and a new, young and dynamic one was to take charge. The outgoing CEO was old, matured and well experienced. The new one was very young and dynamic. While leaving the organization, the old one shared his experiences, expertise, challenges and achievements with the new one.</description>
